# LangGraph Certification Credit Points Agent

An intelligent autonomous agent built with LangGraph that processes Credly certification URLs and calculates credit points based on certification type and validity status.

## 🎯 Goal

Provide an automated system to track, validate, and assign credit points to professional certifications from **Credly URLs**, streamlining the certification evaluation process for organizations and learning platforms.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Smart URL Processing**: Automatically extracts certification details from Credly badge URLs
- ✅ **Expiry Validation**: Checks certification validity against current dates
- 🎓 **Intelligent Categorization**: Assigns credit points based on certification tier and type
- 🤖 **ReAct Pattern**: Uses LangGraph's create_react_agent for autonomous tool execution
- 💬 **Natural Language Support**: Handles both direct URLs and hypothetical certification queries
- ⚡ **Powered by Groq**: Fast inference using Llama-3.3-70B model

4. **Calculate**: Assigns appropriate credit points
5. **Respond**: Formats response based on validity status
